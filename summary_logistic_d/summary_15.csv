# Inference for Stan model: stan_halcyon_logistic_model
# 3 chains: each with iter=(2000,2000,2000); warmup=(0,0,0); thin=(1,1,1); 6000 iterations saved.
# 
# Warmup took (5072, 5292, 5894) seconds, 4.5 hours total
# Sampling took (19424, 5336, 5216) seconds, 8.3 hours total
# Samples were drawn using hmc with nuts.
# For each parameter, N_Eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
# and R_hat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
# convergence, R_hat=1).
